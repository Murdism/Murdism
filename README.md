## About
I work on **perception systems and vehicle-level validation for autonomous vehicles**, with a strong focus on **LiDAR–camera fusion**, **3D object detection**, and **trajectory prediction**. My work bridges **development, field testing, and deployment**, ensuring perception systems are reliable in real-world conditions.

I regularly work with **ROS2**, sensor calibration, ROS bag analysis, and simulation tools to validate perception outputs and support integration with autonomy stacks.

Currently at **Autonomous Vehicle’s Lab (AVLAB), Khalifa University**.
