## 🚗 About
I work on **perception systems and vehicle-level validation for autonomous vehicles**, with hands-on experience spanning **development, simulation, and real-world field testing**. My focus is on building **robust LiDAR–camera perception pipelines** and validating them across **CARLA simulation** and on-vehicle deployments.

I regularly work with **ROS2**, **CARLA**, sensor calibration, ROS bag analysis, and simulation tools to ensure perception outputs are reliable in dynamic, safety-critical environments.

Currently at **Autonomous Vehicle’s Lab (AVLAB), Khalifa University**.
